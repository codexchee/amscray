Automated Manual STIG Checklist-work Reduction Application...Yeah.

This is going to be designed for RHEL 6...possible RHEL 5 for later.

If you're like me, you're a guy that's been tasked with a task that requires a lot of manual effort. If you're like me, you're also lazy and don't like doing said manual effort, especially not "again and again and again and again and again".

This application will have several capabilites that will be developed in phases and possibly scripted in different languages, so I can learn.

The first phase will be taking a completed OS Benchmark checklist and combining it with a Manual OS Review, no replication of work needed. Maybe even at some point, the xml generated by the scanner.

Another phase will be running the additional automation possible scans the Manual OS requires that are not covered in the OS Benchmark.

And yet another phase will be the fixing of the deficiencies that still remain between the Benchmark and the Manual.
